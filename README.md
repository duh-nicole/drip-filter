drip-filter ☕
Filters through data like a slow drip coffee machine — thoughtful, clean, and efficient.

📝 Overview
Drip-Filter is a lightweight, accessible tool designed to help you sort through datasets with intention. Think of it like a pour-over for your info — removing the noise so you're left with a steady, beautifully focused stream of data.

⚙️ Features
Intentional Filtering: Sort through pre-loaded JSON datasets using custom criteria.

Clean Data Tables: View your results in a tidy, high-contrast table designed for scannability.

Accessibility First: Fully keyboard-navigable with focus-visible states and ARIA-compliant table structures.

The CodeLatte Aesthetic: A dark-roast UI that is easy on the eyes during late-night data sessions.

🧰 Tech Stack
JSON: For structured, lightweight data storage.

Tailwind CSS: For the espresso-inspired dark mode and responsive layouts.

JavaScript: Powering the logic that "filters the brew" without refreshing the page.

Python (Optional): Used for backend data processing or local hosting.

♿ Accessibility Notes
Screen Reader Friendly: Tables are structured with proper header scopes.

Keyboard Navigation: Use Tab to move through filter inputs and buttons naturally.

High Contrast: Vanilla text on a deep mocha background ensures WCAG compliance for readability.

🚀 Getting Started
Download or clone the project.

Open index.html in your favorite browser.

Type your criteria into the filter bar and watch the "sediment" disappear from your data table.
